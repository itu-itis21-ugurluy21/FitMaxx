Privacy Policy for PhysiqueAI
Effective Date: October 30, 2023
1. Introduction
Welcome to PhysiqueAI! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application. Your privacy is critically important to us. Our goal is to provide a powerful fitness analysis tool while respecting your data and privacy at every step.
This policy will cover what information we collect, why we need it, and how we use it to provide our services.
2. Information We Collect
To provide our service, we collect the following types of information:
Account Information: When you sign up and log in, we collect your email address and display name provided by your authentication provider (e.g., Google). This is used to create and secure your personal account.
Camera and Image Data: To perform fitness analysis, our app requires access to your device's camera. You use the camera to take photos of your physique.
3. How We Use Your Information
We are committed to using your data only for the purposes of improving your fitness journey.
Email Address: Your email is used solely for account management purposes, such as authentication, security, and restoring your subscription or data across multiple devices. We do not send marketing emails unless you explicitly opt-in.
Camera and Image Data: This is the core of our service.
When you take a photo within the app, it is sent securely to our AI servers for analysis.
The AI processes the image to calculate body composition metrics and generate personalized fitness suggestions.
We do not store your photos. The image is processed in real-time and then immediately and permanently deleted from our servers after the analysis is complete. We only store the resulting fitness data (e.g., body fat percentage, muscle mass metrics) which is associated with your account to track your progress.
4. Permissions We Request
Camera Permission (android.permission.CAMERA): We request this permission so you can take photos directly within the app for analysis. The app cannot function without this permission. We do not access your camera at any other time.
5. Data Security
We take the security of your data seriously. We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption, to protect your information during transmission between your device and our servers. Access to your personal data is strictly limited.
6. Children's Privacy
PhysiqueAI is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it immediately.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
